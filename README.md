# SMA up2 parser

This is a simple parser for up2 files, often used by SMA devices.

The goal is to eventually allow full dumping of their update files.

Currently, the format can be fully parsed.

Also, while the raw firmware data can be extracted, it is not yet possible to understand the firmware binary/executable itself.
